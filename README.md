# finalProject
Hi, This is candycrush project, that is implemented by java.<br />
In my repo, in folder candyAmirali you can see the project doc, UML and Sequence diagram introduce my game to you.<br />
Also in directory "doc" we have javadoc that help you to be informed about the project classes and methodes.<br />
for executing project you can use jar file in "out".<br />
I think that's enough.<br />
Finally , before using my app , make sure that you are familiar to all essentially commands of the game.
