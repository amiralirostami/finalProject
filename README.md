# finalProject
Hi, This is candycrush project, that is implemented by java.
In my repo, in folder candyAmirali you can see the project doc, UML and Sequence diagram introduce my game to you.
Also in directory "doc" we have javadoc that help you to be informed about the project classes and methodes.
for executing project you can use jar file in "out".
I think that's enough
Finally , before using my app , make sure that you are familiar to all essentially commands of the game.
