# finalProject
Hi, This is candycrush project, that is implemented by java.<br />
In my repo, in candyAmirali folder, you can see the project's doc, UML and Sequence diagram that introduce my game to you.<br />
Also in "doc" directory, there is javadoc that inform you about the project's classes and methodes.<br />
for executing project you can use jar file in "out".<br />
I think that's enough.<br />
Finally , before using my app , make sure that you are familiar to all essential commands of the game.
